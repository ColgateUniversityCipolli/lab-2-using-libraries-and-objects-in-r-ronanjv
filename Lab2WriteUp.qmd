* Use `R` [@R] to complete the tasks below. Make sure to start your solutions in on a new line that starts with "**Solution**:".
* Make sure to use the Quarto Cheatsheet. This will make completing and writing up the lab *much* easier.

# Libraries and Packages

## Part a
Install the `esquisse` package for `R`. Report the code below, ensuring to set the `eval` option to `false`, using "\#| eval: false", so that we don't install the package every time you compile your Quarto document.

**Solution**

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("esquisse")
```

## Part b
Load the `esquisse` package for `R`. Report the code below. It does not matter whether you set "\#| eval: false" because loading the package does not add a lot of time. Note you will not evaluate any code that uses the `esquisse` package, so there is no need to load it as you compile your Quarto document.

**Solution**

```{r}
library("esquisse")
```

## Part c
How can you ask for help about the  `esquisse` package for `R`? Report the code below, ensuring to set the `eval` option to `false`, using "\#| eval: false", so that the help document isn't loaded every time you compile your Quarto document.

**Solution**
```{r}
#| eval: false
help("esquisse")
```

## Part d
Is a demo or vignette available for the  `esquisse` package for `R`? Report the code below, ensuring to set the `eval` option to `false`, using "\#| eval: false", so that the you don't get errors when you compile your Quarto document.

**Solution**
```{r}
#| eval: false
demo("esquisse")
vignette("esquisse")
```

## Part e
Add the BibTeX citation for `esquisse` package for `R` to your `.bib` file and cite it in a sentence describing what the package does below. Note you can reference a citation named `esquisse` using "[@\hspace{-0em}esquisse]".
<!-- Note the \hspace{-0em} above is for printing 
the command instead of actually citing. -->

**Solution**

Using esquisse you can explore and visualize your data interactively [@esquisse].

## Part f
Run `esquisser()` in your console -- not in a chunk of `R` code in your Quarto document. 

i. Select `palmerpenguins` from the "Select an environment in which to search:" dropdown. This should automatically select `penguins` in the "Select a data.frame:" dropdown. Click "Import Data".
ii. Drag `body_mass_g` to the X box and `species` to the fill box. 
iii. Describe what you see in words. What can you conclude about Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins based on the resulting plot? 

**Solution**

Adelle penguins are much higher in count, and specifically in the lower body mass area. Gentoo penguins tend towards the higher end of body mass, staying around the 10 count. Chinstrap penguins are lowest in count and between 3500 to 4500 typically in body mass.

# Objects and Vectors
Create the following vectors in `R`. In some cases, you may be able to use `seq()` or `rep()` while in others you cannot. Use these functions when possible, otherwise manually create the vector and explain why that was necessary.

**Some Snowday Notes**

There are three ways we will create a vector. Most simply, we can create one from scratch. For example, I create a vector of odds, and evens less than 10 below.

```{r}
#| size: "scriptsize"
#| code-fold: FALSE
(odds <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9))
(evens <- c(2, 4, 6, 8))
```

There are also built-in functions like `seq(...)` for doing this:
```{r}
#| size: "scriptsize"
#| code-fold: FALSE
(odds <- seq(from=1, to=9, by=2))
(evens <- seq(from=2, to=8, by=2))
```
Either approach is easy enough with a small number of elements, but what if I wanted odds less than 100? 1000? 1 million? The `rep(...)` and `seq()` approaches would be far more efficient.

We can also create repeating sequences by hand
```{r}
#| size: "scriptsize"
#| code-fold: FALSE
(repeating.seq1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3))
(repeating.seq2 <- c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3))
```
or using a built-in function `rep(...)`
```{r}
#| size: "scriptsize"
#| code-fold: FALSE
(repeating.seq1 <- rep(c(1,2,3), times=3))
(repeating.seq2 <- rep(c(1,2,3), each=3))
```

There are some vectors for which we can't use a `seq()` or `rep()`. For example, consider the prime numbers less than 10. The primes are not sequential (e.g., jump by a fixed amount), nor are they repeating.
```{r}
#| size: "scriptsize"
#| code-fold: FALSE
primes <- c(2, 3, 5, 7)
```
**Note**: There is a `primes` package for `R` [@primes] that contains a `generate_primes(min, max)` function for generating a vector of primes from `min` to `max`.


## Part a
The Fibonacci Sequence is a recursive formula:
$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$
where $F_0=0$ and $F_1=1$. 

Create a vector of the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.

## Part b
Triangular Numbers are the cumulative sums of natural numbers:
$$F_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.$$

Create a vector of the first 10 Triangular Numbers. 

## Part c
Suppose I were designing a repeated meausres experiment with three treatment conditions. Each of $n=10$ participants (with `ID` 1 to 10) will receive *all* experimental conditions, call them "Control", "Treatment A", and "Treatment B". 

Consider setting up data entry for this experiment.

i. Create a vector containing each `ID` repeated three times, once for each treatment.
ii. Create a vector containing each `Treatment` repeated for each participant ID.

## Part d
Create a vector containing the `character` "MATH" and the `numeric` 240. What is the resulting class? Explain why in a sentence.
